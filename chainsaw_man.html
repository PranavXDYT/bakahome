<p id="paragraph1">
<strong>Chainsaw Man</strong> is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tatsuki Fujimoto. It was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine from December 2018 to December 2020, with its chapters collected in eleven tankōbon volumes. Chainsaw Man is a manga that I hold in high esteem due to its expansive world building, interesting yet unforgettable characters, and the sudden switches in tone between comedy and horror. In comparison to other works of Shōnen in which the story primarily focuses on the protagnists, Chainsaw Man is able to structure and build upon its side characters enough for readers to feel connected to the characters. In that sense, Tatsuki Fujimoto (mangaka/manga artist) utilizes the bond between reader and character to deliver a decisive emotional blow to a reader's emotional state.

Plot
</h1>
<p id="plot-info">
The story is set in a world where Devils are born from human fears. Devils are usually dangerous and malevolent, their power proportional to the fear they incite. However, humans can form contracts with them to use their power, and there are individuals specializing in hunting and employing them, called Devil hunters. Devils originate from Hell, and exist in a cycle between Earth and Hell: they migrate to Earth when killed in Hell, and vice-versa. Dwelling in Hell are extremely powerful Devils called Primal Fears, which have never been killed. Transit between planes appears to be overseen by the Hell Devil.
<br>
<br>
When his father died, Denji was stuck with a huge debt and no way to pay it back. Thanks to a Devil dog he saved named Pochita, he's able to survive through odd jobs and killing Devils for the Yakuza. Pochita's chainsaw powers come in handy against these powerful demons. When the Yakuza betrays him and he's killed by the Zombie Devil, Pochita sacrifices himself to save his former master. Now Denji has been reborn as some kind of weird Devil-Human hybrid. He is now a Chainsaw Man!
<br>
<br>
After his transformation, he's quickly recruited by Makima to join the Public Safety Devil Hunters under threat of extermination now that he's technically a Devil. Now that he's living comfortably for the first time in his life, Denji struggles to determine his dreams and form meaningful relationships while killing Devils and working alongside other eccentric Devil Hunters.

<p id="power-info">
The Blood Fiend and a Public Safety Devil Hunter in Makima's squad. Power looks like a young woman with long hair; as a Fiend, she has short red horns protruding from her head. Power loves violence and is childish, greedy, almost entirely self-motivated, and willing to harm others for her own satisfaction. Power loves her cat, Meowy, at one point willing to sacrifice Denji's life to save him. She comes to care deeply for Denji and Aki, her first true friends. She is killed by Makima in front of Denji, to break Denji's spirit. Power revives as the Blood Devil from Denji's blood, but is fatally wounded by Makima again. Before dying, Power makes a contract with Denji - in exchange for her blood, she asks Denji to find the reborn Blood Devil and turn her back into Power so that they may be friends again.

He has a contract with the Fox Devil and Curse Devil, allowing him to summon the former's head and use a lethal spike in exchange for his lifespan. He later makes a contract with the Future Devil, allowing him to see a few seconds into the future. Aki is stoic, mature and dependable, but has a soft center when alone. He grows to greatly care about Denji and Power, despite clashing with them. He is killed during a fight between Makima and the Gun Devil, and becomes the Gun Fiend, which Denji is forced to kill.
