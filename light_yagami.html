<p><a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Yagami" target="blank">Light Yagami</a> (Japanese: 夜神月ライト Hepburn: Yagami Raito?) is a fictional character and the protagonist of the manga series Death Note, created by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata. He is a bored young prodigy who finds the Death Note dropped by the Shinigami Ryuk by pure chance. Using the notebook, which allows its owner to kill anyone simply by knowing their name and face, Light becomes a serial-murderer known as Kira (キラ?) in a hubristic attempt to create and rule a utopia cleansed of criminals, with him at the helm as a "god".</p>
  
<p>In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by Mamoru Miyano in Japanese and by Brad Swaile in the English version. In the live-action film series, he is portrayed by Tatsuya Fujiwara with Swaile reprising his role as his English dub voice; he is portrayed by both Kenji Urai and Hayato Kakizawa in the musical;[3] in the TV drama, he is portrayed by Masataka Kubota;[4] and his counterpart in the American film will be portrayed by Nat Wolff.[5]</p>

Creation and conception[edit]
Tsugumi Ohba, the story writer of Death Note, said that his editor suggested the family name "Yagami" for Light. Ohba said that he did not feel "too concerned" about the meaning of the name (the Kanji for "Yagami" are "night" and "god"); he said that after he created the final scene in the manga he "liked" that the final scene created "deeper significance" in the name, of Kira worshippers worshipping him at night under the light of the moon.[6]

Takeshi Obata, the artist of Death Note, said that he had "no trouble" designing Light as the character description presented to him, "A brilliant honors student who's a little out there," was "clear and detailed." As the weekly serialization continued, Obata simplified the design by subconsciously removing "unnecessary" lines and felt that he became "better" at drawing Light. When Chapter 35 appeared and the editor informed Obata that Light loses his memories, Obata had to draw Light in a similar manner as he appeared in Chapter 1; Obata said "It was like I had to forget everything I had learned." Obata said that he used "a lot of effort" to design Light's wardrobe. According to Obata, he encountered difficulty imagining the clothing of "a brilliant person," so he looked through fashion magazines. Obata envisioned Light as a "smart and formal guy" who wears formal shirts. Most of Light's clothing in Death Note is "fitted" and Obata avoided jeans.[7]

When designing color book covers Obata assigned colors to characters to "get the atmosphere right." Obata assigned clear or "lack of a color" to Light.[8]
