<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto_Uzumaki" target="blank">Naruto Uzumaki</a> (うずまき ナルト Uzumaki Naruto?) is a fictional character in the anime and manga franchise Naruto, created by Masashi Kishimoto. The eponymous protagonist of the series, he is a teen ninja from the fictional village of Konohagakure. The villagers ridicule Naruto because of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox—a malevolent creature that attacked Konohagakure—sealed in his body. To be recognized, he aspires to become the village's leader, the Hokage. His cheerful and boisterous personality lets him befriend other Konohagakure ninja, as well as ninja from other villages. Naruto appears in the series' films and in other media related to the franchise, including video games and original video animations.

When creating Naruto in the initial part of the series, Kishimoto kept the character "simple and stupid",[3] while giving him many attributes of an ideal hero. Kishimoto added a harsh past to give him a side of darkness. Many times he has revised Naruto's image, providing the character with different clothes to appeal to Western audiences and make him easier to illustrate. Kishimoto changed his design for Part II of the storyline, which starts two-and-a-half years after Part I. Naruto is voiced by Junko Takeuchi in the original animated series and Maile Flanagan in the English adaptations.

Naruto has remained popular with the Naruto fan-base, placing high in popularity polls. Merchandise based on Naruto has been released, including figurines and keychains. Naruto's character has been praised by anime and manga publications. Although some saw him as a stereotypical manga and anime protagonist comparable to those in other shōnen manga, they have praised his personality and development as he avoids stereotypes.</p>

<p>Naruto Uzumaki is introduced as a young man with blonde, spiky hair and blue eyes. He frequently wears an orange tracksuit. Following his ninja graduation he also wore a headband that denotes his position as a ninja from Konohagakure.[4] In Part II of the manga, which features an older Naruto, he wears a new outfit as a result of his physical growth. The Nine-Tailed Demon Fox sealed in Naruto influences his body, causing him to resemble the Fox over the course of his battles. While initially Naruto only shows small changes such as sharp teeth and claws, he later develops a red tail made of the Fox's vital energy, or chakra.[5] The red chakra starts by surrounding his body; once four tails are manifested, Naruto's blood starts merging with the chakra, coloring his entire body red.[6] As the sixth tail appears, Naruto appears to wear the Fox's skeleton.[7] Once Naruto takes control of the fox's chakra, he is able to maintain his regular form while using it.[8] As a ninja, Naruto carries many weapons,[9] but relies mostly on his ninja techniques while fighting, specializing in making clones of himself.[10]

Introduced as childish clown, Naruto seeks attention as he was ridiculed during his childhood. To be accepted and respected, he resolves to become Konohagakure's Hokage and surpass all the previous leaders no matter the difficulties.[11] While becoming a ninja, Naruto forms friendships he initially lacked, linking some of them to family relationships.[12] Although Naruto sometimes finds himself unable to accomplish the tasks he proposes to do, characters believe that Naruto will be an excellent Hokage because of his positive impact on their lives.[13][14]</p>

<p>In the creation of Naruto, Kishimoto incorporated traits he felt made an ideal hero: a straightforward way of thinking, a mischievous side, and attributes possessed by Goku from the Dragon Ball franchise. Aiming to keep Naruto "simple and stupid",[3] Kishimoto avoided modeling Naruto after anyone in particular, instead conceiving him as naïve with a dark side induced by his harsh past. Despite this, he is always optimistic, a trait Kishimoto says makes him unique.[3] Naruto's personality is, by and large, childish; the creator tries to convey this trait in his illustrations. On the manga cover of volume 10, for example, Naruto is depicted mimicking a turtle as a child might do.[58] Naruto was Kishimoto's first published manga, and he focused on how Naruto's facial expressions would appear in difficult situations, trying make them consistent.[59] He commented "It's rather awkward to talk about what makes Naruto appealing to audiences, but I think his being a knucklehead gives him an appeal;" He believed it was Naruto's loses what made readers identify with him. However, he wanted Naruto to not feel defeat again which was his biggest objective when writing the series.[60]

During the series' publication, Kishimoto got married and had children which influenced Naruto's character. This resulted in Naruto shortly meeting his parents and learning of their sacrifices to help him control the Fox inside him so that he could protect the world in their place. As a result, Naruto appreciated his life more and learned how his parents loved him, something the author wanted the character to feel based on his own experience as a father.[61] Naruto's growth across the series surprised the author due to how the acknowledgement he receives from other characters allows the character even further.[62] By the time Sasuke suffered a drastic change in the plot which made him become one of the series' antagonists, Kishimoto compared Sasuke and Naruto to the yin and yang as a result of their notable differences. As a result, he mentions that whenever one of the two progresses, he makes sure the other does it too.[63] Since the series started serialization, Kishimoto had decided the ending would feature a fight between these two characters.[64] Still, he wanted the fight ending with Naruto forgiving Sasuke similar to the time Naruto forgave Nagato. Naruto's romantic partner was also decided in the middle of the series. Since Hinata Hyuga always respected Naruto even before the series' beginning, he felt they were meant to be. This angered Kishimoto's wife who wanted Naruto to marry Sakura Haruno.[65]

While a realistic ninja wears black in order to be stealthy, Kishimoto gave Naruto an orange jumpsuit to fit the shonen genre.[65] Naruto's wardrobe is based on clothing that Kishimoto wore when he was younger. According to Kishimoto, a pre-existing design would not have made Naruto unique, whereas something original would have made him too distinctive.[66] Because Naruto is associated with spirals in terms of objects he uses, the designer incorporated swirl patterns into the costume.[67] Initial illustrations depicted Naruto in boots, but Kishimoto replaced these with sandals, because he enjoys drawing toes.[68] The goggles that Naruto used to wear were replaced with a hitai-ite, or shinobi headband, because they were too time-consuming to draw.[69] One of the most difficult design choices was the color palette of Naruto's outfit.[70] The orange in his costume makes Naruto "pop" and the blue parts are often used as complements.[4] Kishimoto apologized to the anime staff for Naruto's design, considering it too difficult to translate to animation.[70]

Kishimoto was satisfied that he gave his character blond hair and blue eyes, something rarely seen in Japanese. Therefore, Naruto, along with the immense popularity the series has gained, comes naturally to the readers and international audiences with blond hair and blue eyes. Moreover, the editor of the American magazine Shonen Jump implied that these traits may have made the characters more appealing to Western audiences.[71] Kishimoto most identifies with Naruto of all of the series' characters.[71] When asked why Naruto's favorite food is ramen instead of kitsune udon, Kishimoto said that he personally liked eating ramen.[71][72] In the Naruto: Clash of Ninja video game series, Naruto is playable in various stages of the Demon Fox's manifestation, characterized by a red-colored chakra. Kishimoto took inspiration from the games' presentation of these forms, imitating one of them for the manga cover of volume 26.[73] When designing Naruto for his Part II appearance, Kishimoto drew Naruto's forehead-protector wider to make his eyebrows easier to draw, something that had bothered him in his previous design. He also noted that Naruto's pants made the character look too childish. To remedy this, Kishimoto designed Naruto's pants to roll up, giving him a more mature appearance.[74]

In the original Japanese versions of Naruto, Naruto often ends his sentences with the addendum "-ttebayo" (which achieves an effect similar to ending a sentence with "you know?" in English). Kishimoto wanted to give Naruto a childlike catchphrase, and "dattebayo" came to mind; the creator believed that the phrase complements Naruto's character, and serves as a verbal tic that portrays him in a brat-ish manner.[66] Throughout the first episodes of the English dub version, "dattebayo" and "-ttebayo" were replaced with the phrase "Believe it!", both to mirror the effect and to match the character's lip movements.[75]</p>
